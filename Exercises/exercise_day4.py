Python course EBC 2016
Day 4 - Exercise instructions
Lucas Sinclair <lucas.sinclair@me.com>

* Write a program in a file called "exercise_day4.py"
* You have until the start of the next course at 13h00 tomorrow to finish it.
* Once the program is done, upload it in your github repository "python_homework" in a directory named "day4".

The program should read the file named "lulu_mix_16.csv". This file should be placed in your "home" directory. Your program should use the OS environment variable "$HOME" to find the file.
This file is a comma separated values format. It contains information about different music tracks.

For each line in the file (excluding the header) the program should produce a new "Song" instance. It should place all the Song instances created in a list called "songs".

### Each Song object should have these attributes:

* title
The title of the song as a string.

* artist
The artist of the song as a string.

* duration
The title of the song as an integer in seconds.

When creating new Song instances:

-> If the duration of a song is not a number, set it to 0, but issue a warning.
-> If the duration of a song is negative, raise an Exception and stop the program.

### Each Song object should have these methods:

* pretty_duration(self)
Returns a nice string describing the duration. For instance if the duration is 3611, this methods takes no input and returns "01 hours 00 minutes 11 seconds" as a string.

* play(self)
Automatically opens a webpage on your computer with a youtube search for the title.

Once your program is ready the following four lines of code should run without errors. (After you have removed the negative duration song!).

for s in songs: print s.artist
for s in songs: print s.pretty_duration()
